## The brief - Peer assessment
    
Once we have agreed on the teams and you have had time to discuss your skills and talents we will introduce you to the peer assessment process.

Peer assessment addresses two concerns about team work:
    
1.  Lazy students may get a mark whether or not they do any work;
1.  Such students may pull down the mark of their more able or conscientious colleagues.

The tutors will award a team mark for the project that will be given to each team member. The team is allowed to moderate this mark up or down, within limits, for each member according to pre-established criteria. Thus each student may receive an individual mark that is different from the marks awarded to other members in their team which reflects their overall contribution to the team assignment.
    
All groups must complete and submit the peer assessment documentation for SP5 even if the marks are not going to be adjusted.
    
Printed copies of the forms will be supplied in class. They can also be downloaded - [peer assessment template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_peer_assessment.docx).
    
### Output

Review and discuss the forms. 

You will be required to complete, sign and scan the documents for **SP5**.

*The peer assessment documents are marked at SP5 - see marksheet*.

## The brief - SP1 Team Style Guide

A style guide documents the visual language, such as header styles and colour palettes, used to create the site. It will indicate the voice, tone and writing style for your content and should be used to define your coding conventions (format â€“ html).

### Further reading

- [Front-end Style Guides](https://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/) explained by Anna Debenham. 
- Example [style guides and further reading at styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/).
    
### What to do

Create a style guide for the team website - your colours, media and typography for this site - Use the [template style_guide.html](../../raw/master/templates/template_style_guide.zip).
    
### Output

## SP 1 - What and how to submit.

Submission points 1-4 gives tutors an opportunity to review your work, provide feedback and to check your progress.

For each submission point:

- **SP1** we are reviewing and marking the team website.
- **SP2** we are reviewing the documents and marking the presentation.
- **SP3** - same.
- **SP4** we are marking your preparation and performance in delivering a usability testing session.
- **SP5** we are marking all of the final versions of the documents created through the whole process. We are also marking your project website - The Guide.

## SP1 - What are we marking?

For SP1 we are marking your `Team Website` and `Team style guide`.

## Marks

SP1 is worth 5% of the overall mark for Assessment One.
