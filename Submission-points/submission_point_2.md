- Use the [SP2 presentation template](../../raw/master/templates/template_sp2_presentation.pptx) for your pitch.

## Who is visiting your site?

Before you start creating a website, you need to have thought about why the website needs to exist. What problem is it solving? Who will use it? What jobs do those users want to do?

You will learn about and use a variety of tools and techniques in your research.

## SP2 includes...

*SP2 includes your proposal, user research, analysing competitors, creating personas (to represent your users), the user journeys these personas would take and the development of an information architecture, resulting in a site plan*.

## The brief - Ideation
    
Initial ideas - You will be introduced in class to a variety of ideation techniques, allowing the team to 'brainstorm' and define a number of initial ideas for the project web site (the Guide).
    
### Output

Scan any resulting documents (photograph if too big) and save as a single pdf file. Filename - `ideation.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*This document will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. It is marked at SP5.*

- The above indicates that we will mark the final version of this document at Submission Point 5. 
    
- At Submission Point 2 we will review the current version of your documents and provide feedback and guidance. 
    
- You should take the opportunity after SP2 to use our feedback to improve your submission.

- Use subsequent sprint meetings to show us revised versions.

- Of course you may have got it right first time! Job done.

## The brief - User Research
    
User Research - Undertake some initial user research with friends, family and fellow students to better understand what people would want from the guide you are proposing. Use the [BBC User Research template](../../raw/master/templates/template_user_research.docx) document.
    
Each team member should develop 4 or 5 user profiles. Note - these are not Personas (developed later). These should be based on real people.

You are trying to get the thoughts of 'real' people about the type of product you are about to build (and their experience of similar products).
    
### Output

Save as a single docx file. Filename - `user_research.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your user research will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. It is marked at SP5.*

---

## The brief - Proposal
    
Project Proposal - You are required to create a Proposal (1000 words) that provides brief details of the web site you plan to construct. The client briefing and user research will help inform this document. 

The proposal becomes an agreement between your team and the client about vision and direction of the Guide.

Use the [Proposal template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_proposal.docx) provided.
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `proposal.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your proposal will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Competitor Analysis
    
Competitor Analysis Report - As a team, you are required to review 3 web sites that are similar to the type of site you are building – a guide. These sites may be local, UK-based or overseas (if relevant).
    
You could for example look at any direct, local competitor guides, guides for other cities, examples of good guides (on any topic), and perhaps like guides that are part of larger sites. Avoid Trip Advisor. Analyse the 3 sites using the criteria on the [Competitor Analysis template](../../raw/master/templates/template_competitor_analysis.docx) provided.
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `competitor_analysis.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your competitor analysis will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2 Presentation. It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Personas
    
User Personas - Create 3 user personas based on the user types your research indicates you might expect to use your group’s web site.
    
One must be an international visitor to your site
    
We prefer you to be creative and develop your own personas over using a template site. If you use a template make sure you customise the output.
    
### Output

Format - pdf file. Filename - `personas.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your personas will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. They are marked at SP5.*

## The brief - User Journeys
    
User Journey Mapping - **Develop a user journey for each persona**. Explore what type of interaction(s) these users might typically have with the site. Read the article [When and How to Create Customer Journey Maps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customer-journey-mapping/).
    
Use the [User Journey template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_user_journey.pptx) we have created from [Paul Boag's article](https://boagworld.com/usability/customer-journey-mapping/).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `user_journey.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*A sample user journey will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. They all are marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Information Architecture
    
Information Architecture Report - The team must carry out and record an open card sort and tree jacking exercise to inform your initial site architecture. This will be illustrated as a site plan.
    
Write a short (500 words) illustrated report on the process and results.
    
Use the [report template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_ia_report.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `ia_report.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Not required for the SP2 Presentation. It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Open Card Sorting
    
Card Sort Results - Using paper cards undertake an Open Card sort as (illustrated in class) as a group to get an initial understanding. Then carry out the sort with UserZoom on at least 10 participants. Discuss and illustrate the results in your IA Report.
    
Create an xlsx spreadsheet of your results.
    
### Output

Format - xlsx file. Filename - `card_sort.xlsx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*A summary of the card sort will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation - it may be incomplete at this stage.  It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Tree Jack
    
Tree Jack Results - Test your chosen architecture by creating a Tree Jacking test in UserZoom. Test on at least 10 participants. Discuss and illustrate the results in your IA Report.
    
Create an xlsx spreadsheet of your results.
    
### Output

Format - xlsx file. Filename - `tree_jack.xlsx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*A summary of the tree jack will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation - it may be incomplete at this stage. It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Site Plan
    
Site Plan - This is an illustration of your recommended architecture for the new site based on the findings of your card sorting exercise. You MUST use the formatting illustrated in class. By the end of the project you may have a number of iterations of this plan due to changes as you progress with the project.
    
Use the [site plan template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_site_plan.pptx).
    
You can use the tools in PowerPoint to create a simple tree structure.
    
### Output

Format - pptx file. Filename - `site_plan.pptx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your initial site plan will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. It is marked at SP5.*

## Database schema

### AWDD Students only

Your site needs to hold some of its content in a database – news items, list of events, public artwork names and locations, local cheese varieties, etc etc. You need to think about which ‘fields’ your database will need and what sort of information they would contain. We also need you to create a sketch in code or on paper of how these database fields will be shown on the site on a ‘list page’ and a ‘detail’ page – e.g. the ‘list page’ would list all the cheeses, and the detail page would have all the information about one type of cheese – what does it look like, where can I buy it, who makes it, etc.

### Output

Bring your schema ideas to the presentation to discuss with tutors. Any output can be then scanned and saved as a pdf.

Format - pdf file. Filename - `schema.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.
